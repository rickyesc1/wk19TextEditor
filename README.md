# Week 19 Text-Editor

A single-page PWA (progressive web application) that can be used online and offline, uses IndexDB as a database, and service workers running in the background to give this text-editor amazing functionality. This web-app also comes with an option to install as an icon to your local machine, where it will be accessible from the desktop. You can think of this app like a stripped-down, less-functional but more peaceful VS Code, a text-editor with it's key function being that it stores and saves your code (locally to IndexDB) allowing you to close the window and open it back whenever, to find your code / text exactly how you left it . 

## Description/Demo
